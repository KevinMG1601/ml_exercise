## Overview
This repository contains the solution to a practical machine learning exercise using a product dataset from Mercado Libre Argentina (MLA). The objective is to preprocess the product listing dataset, perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and train a machine learning model to predict whether a product is new or used (condition). 


## Dataset
The dataset, titled **MLA\_100k.jsonlines**, contains 100,000 product listings from Mercado Libre Argentina, each with 48 features. The main objective is to predict the **condition** of a product‚Äîwhether it is *new* or *used*. Key features include **price**, **accepts\_mercadopago**, **listing\_type\_id**, **free\_shipping**, **local\_pick\_up**, **mode**, **initial\_quantity**, **available\_quantity**, **status**, **automatic\_relist**, and **buying\_mode**. The data is stored in **JSON Lines format**, with several fields organized as nested structures (e.g., the **shipping** field).

## Installation And Setup

1. clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/KevinMG1601/ml_exercise.git
```
2. Installing the dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 
3. Run the notebooks, first the one for EDA and then the one for training the model.

## Results
Six classification models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting and XGBoost. The objective was to predict whether a product is new or used.

The following metrics were used to compare the performance of each model:
* **Accuracy:** measures the total proportion of correct predictions.
* **Precision:** indicates how accurate the positive predictions are (used products).
* **Recall:** shows how many used products were correctly identified.
* **F1-Score:** balances precision and recall in a single metric.
* **ROC-AUC:** evaluates the overall ability of the model to distinguish between classes.

| Modelo              | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **XGBoost**         | **0.8300** | 0.8059   | **0.8353** | **0.8203** | **0.8303** |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.8212   | **0.8097** | 0.8041 | 0.8069   | 0.8200  |
| Random Forest       | 0.8212   | 0.7762   | 0.8643 | 0.8179   | 0.8240  |
| Decision Tree       | 0.8191   | 0.7778   | 0.8549 | 0.8145   | 0.8215  |
| KNN                 | 0.8064   | 0.7820   | 0.8088 | 0.7952   | 0.8066  |
| Logistic Regression | 0.7335   | 0.9038   | 0.4771 | 0.6245   | 0.7165  |


## Conclusion 
After training and evaluating multiple classification algorithms ‚Äî including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost ‚Äî it was determined that XGBoost is the most effective model for predicting whether a product is new or used.

The XGBoost model achieved the following results on the test set:

* Accuracy: 83.00%.
* Accuracy: 80.59
* Recall: 83.53
* F1-Score: 82.03%.

This represents the best balance between accuracy (avoiding false positives) and recall (detecting the most used products), achieving the highest F1-Score among all models evaluated. Its ability to handle non-linear relationships and avoid over-fitting thanks to regularization makes it a solid and robust option for this problem.
